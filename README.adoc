== Overview

**ZeroProb.jl** is a Julia library for handling zero-probability events in continuous probability spaces.

> In continuous probability distributions, events with measure zero can still occur. This library provides rigorous mathematical tools for reasoning about such events.

== The Zero-Probability Paradox

In continuous probability theory, individual points have measure zero (P(X = x) = 0), yet one such point must occur when sampling. This creates a paradox:

* **Probability:** P(X = 3.14159...) = 0
* **Reality:** X can equal exactly 3.14159...
* **Problem:** How do we reason about relevance when probability is always zero?

== Solution: Alternative Relevance Measures

ZeroProb.jl provides three complementary approaches:

=== 1. Density Ratio
Compare probability densities instead of probabilities:

[source,julia]
----
relevance = density_ratio(f, x, baseline)
# Higher density → more "typical" for the distribution
----

=== 2. Hausdorff Measure
Use dimensional analysis for sets of measure zero:

[source,julia]
----
measure = hausdorff_measure(event_set, dimension)
# Generalizes volume to fractional dimensions
----

=== 3. ε-Neighborhood Probability
Consider probability mass in small neighborhoods:

[source,julia]
----
prob_ε = epsilon_neighborhood_prob(X, x, ε)
# P(|X - x| < ε) as ε → 0
----

== Installation

From Julia REPL:

[source,julia]
----
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ZeroProb")
----

== Usage Examples

=== Density Ratio Analysis

[source,julia]
----
using ZeroProb, Distributions

# Define distribution
dist = Normal(0, 1)

# Compare relevance of two points
x1 = 0.0    # At mean
x2 = 3.0    # 3 standard deviations out

ratio = density_ratio(dist, x1, x2)
# ratio ≈ 228.0 (x1 is 228× more "typical")
----

=== Hausdorff Measure for Fractals

[source,julia]
----
using ZeroProb

# Cantor set has Hausdorff dimension log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.631
cantor_set = construct_cantor_set(iterations=10)
dimension = hausdorff_dimension(cantor_set)
measure = hausdorff_measure(cantor_set, dimension)

# Even though Lebesgue measure is 0, Hausdorff measure is non-zero
----

=== ε-Neighborhood Convergence

[source,julia]
----
using ZeroProb, Distributions

dist = Exponential(1.0)
x = 2.0

# Compute probability in shrinking neighborhoods
ε_values = [0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]
probs = [epsilon_neighborhood_prob(dist, x, ε) for ε in ε_values]

# Observe convergence rate
convergence_rate = estimate_convergence_rate(ε_values, probs)
----

== API Reference

=== Core Functions

`density_ratio(dist, x, baseline)`::
Compare probability density at `x` to density at `baseline` point.

`hausdorff_measure(set, dimension)`::
Compute Hausdorff measure of `set` at given `dimension`.

`hausdorff_dimension(set)`::
Estimate Hausdorff dimension of `set` using box-counting.

`epsilon_neighborhood_prob(dist, x, ε)`::
Compute P(|X - x| < ε) for distribution `dist`.

`estimate_convergence_rate(ε_values, prob_values)`::
Estimate rate at which P(|X - x| < ε) → 0 as ε → 0.

=== Mathematical Background

The library implements results from:

* **Measure Theory**: Hausdorff measures generalize Lebesgue measure
* **Probability Theory**: Density functions as relevance indicators
* **Fractal Geometry**: Box-counting dimension estimation
* **Asymptotic Analysis**: Convergence rate estimation

== Integration with ECHIDNA

ZeroProb.jl is designed for use with ECHIDNA's probabilistic reasoning:

* **Premise Selection**: Rank premises by density ratio instead of raw probability
* **Proof Search**: Use ε-neighborhood probability to guide search
* **Anomaly Detection**: Flag events far from distribution support using Hausdorff measures
